## backstory
i like listening to music, and at time when my phone was dead I had to use my school provided chromebooks to listen music but, the populatur music streaming apps were blocked and inaccessible so i had created my own online music player for me and my classmates, and started this project in September 22, 2023.
> September 22, 2023 according to the first git repo
